1.
Both changes to the number

TRIS(E) chooses which ports are used
TRISECLR 31:0 Write clears selected bits in TRISE, read yields undefined value
TRISESET 31:0 Write sets selected bits in TRISE, read yields undefined value

?

7:0 enligt data sheet


2.
IFSCLR(0) in code

Uppdateras snabbt (timern går upp) goes through once but not again

PR2 = (80000000 / 256) / 10; // 80 million comes from that timer2 operates at 80 MHz. After /256 / 10 we get 31250 Hz. KOLLA SLIDE 10 PRESENATION 6
  T2CONSET = 0x70; //Setting prescale //Check family referece for timers and page 14-9
  TMR2 = 0; //Set timer to 0 to begin with.
  T2CONSET = 0x8000; //turn timer on. set bit 15 to 1. Check family reference for timers and page 14-9

Ändra tid för uppdateringsfrekvensen, så man hinner uppdatera innan man trycker

Clock is not hex, the higher you go the faster it updates, especially with hex (A to F)


3.
it clears

it would be 1 all the time so it doesnt clear doesnt work good

in the asm code vectors.S to see any interrupts, to be used

those are used by user_isr, something can happen to them in the user_isr so the're saved so nothing happens, the others dont need to be saved since nothing can happen to them

enable_interrupt --> IPC(2)
